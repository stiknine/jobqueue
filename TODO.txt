-- TO DO --

- Test attaching scripts through the setup app, if it works without creating loops then create a routine to attach scripts.

- Create a job log, write each job to file as a way to keep a list of what to process with the ability to create lists dynamically or manually.

- Ability to process multiple jobs.

- Better documentation/comments.

- Provide more and better example scripts.
